## Video blows out in `qv4l2` Qt application

1. In the file menu, open the 'Capture' section.
2. Uncheck 'Use OpenGL Rendering.'

## Input video framerate doesn't match stated camera specs

Check the ambient brightness of the room. If it is too dark, the camera need to
increase its aperture time to get a well-exposed image, which will consequently
lower the framerate. To verify that this is indeed happening, disable any
automatic aperture settings and lower the exposure time. The video stream will
become more responsive.
