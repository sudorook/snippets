## Direct download URL

To generate a direct download URL for a file on Google Drive, edit the URL for
the file viewer to read:
```
https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=<ID NUMBER>
```

where `<ID NUMBER>` is replaced with the ID for in the URL.

**Note:** This does not work for large files that trigger Google's virus scan
warning.
