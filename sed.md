# sed (stream editor)

## Use literal '-' in regex range expression

To include a hyphen ('-') in a range expression, it must be escaped and placed
either at the start or end of the expression.

## Strip ANSI color codes from text stream or files

To remove color escape sequences from files, such as in text files generated by
logging colorized terminal `stdout`, use:
```
sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m//g'
```
