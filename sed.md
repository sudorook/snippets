# sed (stream editor)

## Use literal '-' in regex range expression

To include a hyphen ('-') in a range expression, it must be escaped and placed
either at the start or end of the expression.

## Strip ANSI color codes from text stream or files

To remove color escape sequences from files, such as in text files generated by
logging colorized terminal `stdout`, use:

```sh
sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m//g'
```

## Print all text after a regex match

To match all text after a particular pattern, use:

```sh
... | sed -n '/<regex</,$p'
```

Note that this will include the pattern-matched line itself in the output.

## Remove all text between and including a pattern

```sh
sed -e '/pattern1/,/pattern2/d'
```
