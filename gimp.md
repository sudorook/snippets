# GIMP

## Enable single window mode

Tired of dealing with the side windows? Are they obscured or obscuring what
you're working on? Do you accidentally close one of them and struggle to figure
out how to reopen it? Never fear! You can open GIMP in one big window, with
different images displayed in separate tabs.

1. Go the to top menu in the main (center) window.
2. Select the 'Window' drop-down menu.
3. Tick the 'Single-Window Mode' checkbox.
