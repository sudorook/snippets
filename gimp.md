# GIMP

## Enable single window mode

Tired of dealing with the side window? Are they obscured or obscuring what
you're working on? Do you accidentally close one and struggle to figure out how
to reopen it? Never fear! You can have gimp open in one big window (with
different images as separate tabs rather than separate windows).

1. Go the to top menu in the main (center) window.
2. Select the 'Window' drop-down menu.
3. Tick the 'Single-Window Mode' checkbox.
